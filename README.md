## How to run
1. Run javac Paxos.java (we used Java 1.8)
2. Run java Paxos which will start a console
3. Enter the number of nodes (say 20)
4. You can see the log of each node in nodeLog directory
5. The console can be used to enter kill commands like "kill 5" which will sleep the fifth node. The effects of this on other nodes can be seen using the node logs.
